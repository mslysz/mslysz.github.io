          <p>
            In November 2022 I decided that I needed to change something in my
            professional life, my choice was to become a programmer. I had long
            been interested in creating simple, basic websites. My choice was to
            learn how to create websites and web applications. I started with
            online courses, from YouTube, Udemy. I am currently doing a Software
            developer course at the Pitman School based in Edinburgh. I am
            trying to progress as quickly as possible and get the best knowledge
            possible. In the near future I want to get employed as a
            Front-End-Developer.
